				        <p>Antidote seamlessly integrates the insurance and drug data consumers need to make an educated decision about medication usage.  We combine trusted information from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and National Library of Medicine (NIH) and pair this with user-based experience of the drugs to provide a personalized approach to medical decision making.</p>

						<p>More than just a website, Antidote is also an open source platform that provides a powerful API that transforms FDA and NIH data on drug and adverse effects information and couples user reviews in a clean, easy-to-use format.  This well documented, organized API can be leveraged by other parties to further other development efforts.</p>

						<p>Antidote is a prototype web application and platform created by Symplicity Corporation in order to meet the requirements for submission to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 4QTFHS150004.  This RFQ was issued by The General Services Administration (GSA) in order to establish a list of vendors as part of a blanket purchase agreement to supply agile delivery services.</p>
