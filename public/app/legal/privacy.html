                        <h4>COOKIES</h4>
                        <p>Symplicity may use third-party advertising or analytics companies who may place or access cookies on your computer hard drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and to keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the webs pages on which the ads appeared. Symplicity may allow these other companies to display advertisements to you while you are using our Site and applications if colleges and universities have chosen to enable that functionality. Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the other companies’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. These companies operate under their own privacy policies and Symplicity encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies. Symplicity does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers. To help prevent and limit the automatic collection of information by any participating third party advertisers, you may opt-out of such collection by clicking the Ad Choices icon located within the ad, by accessing the “about ads” opt-out site, or by accessing the NAI opt-out site. Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again.</p>

                        <h4>SECURITY</h4>
                        <p>We use our best efforts to protect the personally identifiable information submitted by users through the Site in a commercially reasonable manner. We use encryption for all sensitive information. Access to our users’ personally identifiable information is restricted only to the Symplicity employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative).</p>
                        <p>In addition, user data is password protected, so only you (or third parties you provide your Site password to) can access this information. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of your Site logon and password. We will have no liability for disclosure of such data, including without limitations due to errors in transmission or interception by unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>
                        <p>All personally identifiable information that the Site collects about you is stored in limited-access servers. Symplicity has technical, administrative, and physical security measures and safeguards in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. The Site uses secure servers to protect from loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.</p>
                        <p>Symplicity does not review submissions or other information posted by users of the Site. Site users are urged to validate information and use caution and common sense when applying and relying on such data. For example, do not disclose Social Security numbers, credit card information, or bank account numbers with unknown users. Information on this site does not constitute medical advice or replace the need to consult a health care professional on the use of any medicine.</p>
                        <p>Although Symplicity strives to provide a high standard of security and privacy, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure or effective, and Symplicity does not guarantee or warrant to the security and privacy of any data, information or content. You should be mindful to share only the information that they feel comfortable under these circumstances.</p>
