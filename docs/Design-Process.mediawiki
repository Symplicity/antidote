This page documents the design process utilized for the iterative development of Antidote.  We utilized multiple [human-centered design methods] (http://www.designkit.org/methods) within the [Google Venture Design Sprint] (http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672887/how-to-conduct-your-own-google-design-sprint) framework to ground our design approach firmly within the needs of our potential consumers. 

==Understand==
In order to understand we: 
*Engaged in individual research
*Reviewed the information provided by OpenFDA
*Brainstormed as a team to determine initial direction and to determine survey questions:

[[https://github.com/Symplicity/antidote/blob/master/docs/attachments/brainstorm1.jpg]]
*Conducted a user survey, created by the Content Writer (Technical Approach, Criteria 3 & 4) [[Design Process: A. Initial Survey]]
*Interviewed survey respondents to dig deeper (Technical Approach, Criteria 3 & 4) [[Design Process: B. Interviews]]
*Reviewed interview results for user needs and identified a problem statement:

==Diverge==
To generate creative ideas:
*We separated to create sketches of applications that would meet the user needs. (Technical Approach, Criteria 4) [[Design Process: C. Sketch Activity]]
*We used our problem statement as a guideline for this work (Technical Approach, Criteria 4) 

==Decide==
To determine the most effective approach to meet our users needs:
*We voted on the sketches and chose a winner: https://github.com/Symplicity/antidote/wiki/Iterations#V10
*And combined our top two voted sketches into a design prototype 

==Prototype==
Our discussion during the decision phase generated an initial version: https://github.com/Symplicity/antidote/wiki/Iterations#V20

==Validate==
We validated our approach by:
*Engaging in user testing of the prototype (Technical Approach, Criteria 3) [[Design Process: D. Usability Testing for Prototype]]
*Continuing feedback at after development (Technical Approach, Criteria 3) [[Design Process: D. Usability Testing for Website]] and [[Design Process: D. Usability Testing for Website: Insights]]
