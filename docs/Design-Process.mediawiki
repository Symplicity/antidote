This page documents the design process utilized for the iterative development of Antidote.  We utilized multiple [human-centered design methods] (http://www.designkit.org/methods) within the [Google Venture Design Sprint] (http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672887/how-to-conduct-your-own-google-design-sprint) framework to ground our design approach firmly within the needs of our potential consumers.

*Reviewed interview results for user needs

==Diverge==
To generate creative ideas:
*We separated to create sketches of applications that would meet the user needs. (Technical Approach, Criteria 4)
*We used our problem statement as a guideline for this work (Technical Approach, Criteria 4):

==Decide==
To determine the most effective approach to meet our users needs:
*We voted on the sketches
*And combined our top two voted sketches into a final product

==Prototype==
Our ____ (title) generated an initial version based on discussion from the decision phase

==Validate==
We validated our approach by:
*Engaging in user testing of the prototype (Technical Approach, Criteria 3)
