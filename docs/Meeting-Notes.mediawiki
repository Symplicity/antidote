==3 pm Testing results review==
*CH will do content, which will be done by Monday
*mocks-placeholder
*docker is in process
*CS is working on mocks, but this will be ongoing so he will give SS a structure to go off of for tomorrow so SS & CT can start on front end development
*QS-prototype & start mobile prototype tomorrow; she will get it done before Monday
*SS will start front end coding based on prototypes
*Services to fetch data
*Routes and controllers
*We can do directives and controllers-they need endpoints
*Backend web stuff
*start on user stories

==11 am Prototype review==
*Confirm/explain change in scope that occurred as a result of conversation later on 6/18
**we cut out personal history and reminders
*Figure out age/identifying info
*People won't scroll-combine/make blocks
*We can't store anything until they submit; could store at the point of effectiveness-get rid of continue; once they click face it goes to next page
*next one should be a done button
*Can we get encryption done if we store user data?
**Vik will encrypt data by deadline; anything that will tie back to identify user
**No need for zip; average recovery time
*Add showing image of drug
*What drug is used for may have to be crowd sourced
**research API for what data can be displayed in "Used for"
**side effects-our database vs. fda
**Used for section in API is not parseable
*Perhaps add icons for pregnancy safety, etc., causes death, cancer, controlled substance
*Number of people with side effects
**Total # of side effects; full page with full side effects; take it a layer deeper if there are side effects
**Icon or something to show what data source is; crowd sourced vs. fda
*show source of data-disclaimer-subtle
*reactions/side effects need clear labeling
*don't like click and close; need to find material design element to expand/slide
*how are we going to populate test data?
*put interactivity at top (drug event)
*reviews instead
*indications are "used for"
*add "was this useful?" for review
*taking out tips (or make crowd sourced)
*insurance - company and plan-design figures out list display- look for api
*Users info gathered-age, zip, insurance plan and gender, email
*karma points tied to you
**your karma points are higher when you view it
*we need a disclaimer
*part of checklist is security
*due by 5 pm-playbook chores
*Pivotal Tracker-Iva will help Chelsea and Chris learn it
*Write-wiki page on procedural stuff to send out
*every time we do new feature-pull request
*Using github issues to report bugs? Yes

==Tech team, 10:30 am==
*Identifying bottle necks and hard deadlines: we don't have a lot of bottlenecks
*Help with documentation-plain text file
**What fields we are putting out from aPI
*Front end devs design around sample file that Iva will generate from fda stuff we get
*Write up ndc number
*System to verify that it works
*Get on github and edit it
*Iva-samples of data
*Vik-working on backend API so front end guys can go at it; consuming fda api
*Svemir-automation add api testing bit and some real tests; not that much code in to test right now; moose-setting up docker container; figure out how to build/host
*Dags-facilitating; AWS or Heroku-reading up
*Solutions outstanding? 
**There will be more added-might add one more thing to infrastructure; proper caching.  
**Add that layer not hard; focus on meat of it first
*Other things we could be working on
**setting up dredd thing to test blueprint api
**load testing-missing in general; mentioned in playbook
*Request for support forum: 
**feature stories on pivotal-bugs/issues should be publicly available
**bugs in github
*Anyone not working should be testing
**Determine issues/ramifications ex: zip code personally identifiable & hipaa compliance

==3:00 pm Eastern, Reviewing Chosen Sketch==
**Winning sketch: #2
*What would it take to pull this off?  Are there amendments?
**Obtaining insurance info: crowd source info for insurance
**percent covered by insurance
**too many different insurers/plans
**% of people covered
**zoc doc contains simplified insurance plan list so we could refer to this
**fda data for matches of symptoms
*Drug info to display:
**Perscription or OTC
**Overview
**Uses
**Reviews-effectiveness-user generated
**side effects from API
**Interactivity
**Success rate
**there is info about what it is used to treat
**add three aspects to area that currently has reviews-effectiveness, side effects, insurance covered
*Discussion about lack of clarity on how stats are represented: Is this showing commonness of them
*List of what info is needed: 
**IA will review API and consult with QS regarding how these should be formatted
**Side effect data will be investigated (Dave says in this is in Adverse Events/reactions list)
**Is there a summary? yes
**Used for-not sure if we have this
**Whether prescription or OTC
**Alternatives-other drugs in same class
**what does side effect look like?
**overall summary with click for more details
**suggested usage-what is there?
**Interactivity info; what does this look like-not just other meds-can be foods, etc.
**Reviews section; need to add karma to vote up/down
**Demographic info
***sign up to manage account-email, password
***issues with collecting user data b/c it needs to be encryption is an issue
***can we do username, zip and password and no email, age, gender, insurance co
***get demographic information when you write a review
***timeline for medication
***List view of all of drugs-show notifications new notice for drug-fda warnings, recalls, effectiveness has changed more than 10%
**take out the reminder piece & history of medication use; get away from ongoing health management
**do we do logins?
**give them a reward-we will customize their data to them if they put in age, etc.
*Next steps/schedule:
**prototypes amended by 11 am
**IA looks at data now and gives it to QS
**Write out task for prototype for interview
**Testing Script-CS
**During lunch-prototype testing 11-12 testing, 4 people
**11-2 interviews/reviews
**2:00 review results in group
**Have something working by Monday and give it to users

==1:00 pm Eastern, Interview results==
*9 people were interviewed
**mostly single prescription 
**not many with six or more prescriptions with interactivity issues
*discussed how they research before or after taking medicine
**on google or web md
**trust issue b/c different info comes up
**Online reviews: some people don’t respect and say disrespectful things online
**talk to pharmacist
**Look for interactivity info and side effects
**social network to get info from other people
**check if medication is safe
**if friends/family are taking same medication
**check other people’s reactions and side effects
**check if medication is covered by insurance
**is it dr. recommended, if covered, price
**care about side effects
***70% research before-general side effects
***70% care about how other people afterward
***don’t care about interactivity
***most people don’t have experience of asking family about prescriptions 
**reminders:
***part will remember to take the medication
***some do phone reminder
***A lot of people don’t take note of what they took
**1 longterm perscription
**as long as they take it not worried about recording it
***forgot to take medicine over the weekend b/c on different schedule
***reminder could be a feature
*rely on doctor for interactivity b/c doctor will tell them
*What are our users' problems
**generic or brandname-insurance websites
**Finding a trusted source for side effect info
**Finding generic versions
**knowing whether it was effective for others?
**differentiate clinical data from user feedback
**How do we create a product that provides a mix of unbiased and user-based feedback
**go online to look up side effects
**trusted sources
**reviews from others
**look at clinical info-data is skewed: report only negative reactions
**how do we get users to be more proactive
*What we need:
**create a tool you will use on a larger basis; keep people engaged
**reminder feature
**when you finish doses, game/points for giving feedback
**separate from message board concept
**show generics of that drug
*Problem statement should be a large one:
**helping people have a better experience with prescription and otc medications through access to better and real time information
**Keep engaged to present better information 
**Reminders
**Drug history/inventory
**being able to look up info about the drug
**able to see ratings data-clinical and non-clinical
*Sketches we will put in front of users; we only need a couple
*group vote by tally to find a clear winner to bring to users 
*api to give pictures of boxes etc.
Our sketchers: 
*#1-CS
*#2-QS
*#3-CT
*#4-BS
*#5-IA
