This page outlines the iterative design and development processes in which we engaged in order to bring Antidote to the public.  Prototypes and mocks went through iterations based on user and development team feedback while front and backend development were progressing.  Once a working application was in place, we engaged in further changes based on user and group feedback.  

==Prototyping==

All prototypes are created in Axure, including main pages and interactions in the system, both web and mobile versions.

===Mock Iterations===
While development began immediately based on prototypes, various iterations of mocks were created to complement and confirm development trajectory as well as achieve design cohesiveness.  A document that discusses the iterations our mocks went through is linked here.

===Roadmap===
Our minimum viable product (MVP) consisted of the completed user stories documented in Pivotal Tracker.  These user stories were paired with feature tasks to track the development details associated with features and provide a checklist to verify completion of requirements.  All features that did not meet the MVP were placed in the Pivotal Tracker icebox for incorporation into a product roadmap.  The Pivotal Tracker roadmap and full history are available here for anyone who wishes to enhance Antidote moving forward.
