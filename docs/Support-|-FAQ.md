### Using Antidote

- What is Antidote?   

  Antidote provides medication information for the general public. The information includes drug type, description, side effects, effectiveness, if it's covered by insurance, etc. The data is from both Open FDA database and users' reviews within the system. The aim of this website is to provide better a medication research experience for the general public. 

- What data is from FDA and what is user generated?

  The medication description, manufacturer, used for, side effects and recalls are from FDA database. Effectiveness, if it's covered by insurance and reviews are from user generated data.

### Review

- Why do I need to login before I post a review?  

  This will prevent spam information in our site and ensure the data is well generated and can be trusted. And once you login and review, your gender and age can be collected so that users can see relevant review results.

- Where can I see my review after I post a review?   

  Since the reviews are sorted by thumb up votes from other users, the most voted review will stay at the top. So your review will appear based on how many thumb up votes you have from other users.  When you first enter your review, it will not have any votes and so will be toward the bottom of the list.

### Account 

- Why is gender and age requested when I sign up?  

  Providing age and gender allows users who are searching medications to see the degree to which the information may be relevant to their own experience.

- How can I change my password?
  
  Go to your profile, there you can change your username, email address, gender, age and password.

- What if I forget my password?

  There is a "forgot password" link on the login form. If you click this link, you will be requested to submit your email. Upon receipt of this request, the system will send you an email with a link to reset your password.
